# Simon

## Description
### *Why Play Simon?*

Flex your developer muscles with a memory game. Sure, coding involves lots of logic and math. However, if a coder doesn't do their reps, then they'll never remember each coding language's patterns. Work your memory muscles with Simon, the ultimate memory game.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Getting Started

**[Play the Game] (https://milcahhalili.github.io/Simon/)**

### *How to Play*

When the player clicks the **START** button, then the game begins. A random circle will flash, beginning the first sequence. The number of flashing circles corresponds with the number of the current turn. For example, five circles will flash on turn number five.

This version of Simon doesn't have the typical win-lose logic. As long as the player remembers each turn correctly, then the player can advance to an infinite number of turns. If the player clicks on the wrong sequence, then the game is over.

## Next Steps

### *Bugs*

The console returns

> *Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 (Forbidden)*

in regards to the audio, mp3 links, despite the fact that the sounds do load.

On mobile phones, the game does not conform to the size of the screen.

### *Build On!*

If you'd like to build upon the current version of this game, then I'd suggest you create a **HIGH SCORE** feature.

Another potential feature would be to add a setTimeout function that resets the animateSequence function if the player does not make a move after a certain amount of seconds.

Lastly, refer to the **Bugs** section above for further building suggestions.
